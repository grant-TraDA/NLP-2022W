# NLP-2022-fake-news

**Authors** : Arkadiusz Zalas, Mateusz Wojcik, Marcel Affi

This project aims to detect news that contain mis-
information, particularly fake news, based on e.g.
online article texts. Since nowadays anyone can
run a blog and write whatever they please, it
is crucial to be able to differentiate between so-
called real and fake news. We will test and com-
pare different methods for misinformation detec-
tion (MID) using multiple datasets.
